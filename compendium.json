Remorseless, implacable foes, the Rubric Marines are forever cursed. They bestride the galaxy in armoured suits that are little more than sealed tombs, within which only a handful of dust remains of what was once a proud Space Marine. During the razing of their homeworld Prospero, the Thousand Sons Legion was forced to flee its beloved capital city of Tizca. The Emperor had sent against them the Space Wolves, the Custodian Guard and the Sisters of Silence, His intent to call the Primarch Magnus and his fellow psykers of the XV Legion to account. For all their esoteric skill, the Thousand Sons could not stand against the combined might of these invaders, and escaped to the Eye of Terror and the Planet of the Sorcerers, Sortiarius, that awaited them there through a Warp Gate opened by their Sorcerers and Magnus. However, their rapid evasion and dabbling with forbidden powers was not without price. ",

Even if a Novitiate has already been chosen to serve within a particular Order during that time, their trainers will demand that the Novitiates know the basic skills of all of the Adepta's Orders.
